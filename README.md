# RL-NLP

### CLVR Datasets: 
* [CLVR original dataset page](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/)
* [CLVR preprocessing github](https://github.com/facebookresearch/clevr-iep/blob/master/TRAINING.md)
* [CLOSURE dataset github page](https://github.com/rizar/CLOSURE)

### TODO: 
#### Alice
* Re-launch experiments for LM Network Training 
* Finalize the implementation of the LSTM with LayerNorm
* Look @ Methods to merge the image features and the text embeddings. 
* Finalize a simple REINFORCE algo. 

#### Guillaume. 
* Statistics functions for the dataset (to be used later on for episode statistics)
* Work on reward functions. 
* Other PG algos. 
* (Supervised Learning of the Policy Network.)



#### Example of use 
`cd src`

`python -m scripts.run`
